              <p style="text-align: justify;">
              With the recent developments on the COVID-19 outbreak and the increasing number of incidents not only in the Philippines but around the globe, the Philippine Normal University continues to exercise vigilance and proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
              <br>
              <br>
              Faculty members, administrative staff, and students are still encouraged to limit their activities, especially outside the University, to avoid exposure. Official travel to countries with or without confirmed cases will likewise be very limited.<br>
              <br>
              For those who have recently travelled to countries with confirmed cases and have experienced symptoms of severe respiratory illness or other signs of COVID-19, please seek medical attention immediately.
              <br>
              <br>
              Safety mechanisms and protective measures
              <br>
              <br>
              1. Gate 1 and Gate 2 of the Main Entrance and HRD Gate will be used for entry and exit. Access to the other gates will be very limited. Medical personnel are on standby on both gates to do temperature check and, in case of emergency, provide immediate medical attention to the individual showing symptoms. Rubbing alcohol and sanitizers are also available in strategic places around the campus.
              <br>
              <br>
              2. The University Health Services Unit (UHSU) has a limited supply of protective gear; thus faculty members, administrative staff, and students are encouraged to provide for their own.
              <br>
              <br>
              3. Prevention is better than cure. Always practice good personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle. Wash hands frequently with soap and water and disinfect with alcohol-based solutions whenever possible. Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent contamination. Make sure to follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering the mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then disposing of the used tissue paper immediately.
              <br>
              <br>
              4. Boost the immune system by eating healthy food and taking vitamins, if any.
              <br>
              <br>
              5. Maintain social distancing. Make sure to leave at least 1 meter distance from anyone who is coughing and sneezing.
              <br>
              <br>
              6. Stay calm but vigilant at all times. Do not panic.
              <br>
              <br>
              7. Anyone experiencing any symptoms of the COVID-19 is advised to seek medical attention immediately and stay home to rest.
              <br>
              <br>
              The University is currently monitoring the situation with the help of other government agencies. Further announcements regarding the COVID-19 will be released once available. 
              <br>
              <br>
              For concerns, inquiries, and assistance, please contact the UHSU through (+63 2) 5317.1768 loc. 592 or via email at uhsu@pnu.edu.ph.

                <br>
                The University has carefully considered the current situation and is initiating measures to prevent the spread of the virus such as more thorough monitoring of people going in and out of the campus, careful preparations of equipment and facilities, and formulation of response protocols. Plans are underway to purchase additional rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizers, protective gear, and thermal scanners.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a precautionary measure, people entering the campus will have their temperature checked. Rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers will be available at the gates, restrooms, and strategic places around the campus. Protective masks will be provided by the University Health Services Unit (UHSU) until supplies last.

              <b>HOW TO MAKE BANANA HEART SISIG </b>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>INGREDIENTS:</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              1 medium size Banana blossom (puso ng saging) cleaned and remove the outer hard part
              <br>
              1 large onion (minced)
              <br>
              4 cloves garlic (minced)
              <br>
              3 tablespoons calamansi or lemon juice
              <br>
              ¼ cup soy sauce
              <br>
              1 egg
              <br>
              Salt and pepper to taste
              <br>
              1 tablespoon mayonnaise (optional)
              <br>
              2 pcs red chili pepper (garnish)
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>PROCEDURE:</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              1.       Prepare the banana blossom and chopped it. In a pot, boil it until soft. Drain from the water and let it cool. Chopped it like any sisig (very small or almost ground). Make sure to squeeze out excess water until dry.
              <br>
              <br>
              2.       In a pan, sautéed the garlic and onion then toss in the chopped banana blossom and mix well.
              <br>
              <br>
              3.       Season with soy sauce and lemon juice. Let it simmer for seven minutes. Adjust heat to medium fire and occasionally stirring to prevent toasting.
              <br>
              <br>
              4.       Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss it well to incorporate your seasoning. Make a small hole in the center of the sautéed banana blossoms, then crack an egg. Turn of the heat after few seconds, allow the egg to cook on remaining heat.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you want it a little creamy, add mayonnaise once heat and turn off ( to avoid turning the mayonnaise into oil if heat is turned on) and mix well.
              <br>
              <br>
              You may add leftover chicken or pork and minced it to add variety to your sisig.
              <br>
