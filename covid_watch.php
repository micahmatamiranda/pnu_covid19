                <p><strong>The Status</strong></p>
                <p>The Department of Health (DOH) has confirmed the first case of a person with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 30, 2020. In addition, DOH records 56 “nCoV-related health events” (not patients) in the Philippines as of January 31, 2020. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current outbreak originated in Wuhan City in China, which is a major domestic and international transport hub. Some of the countries with reported confirmed cases are Thailand, Japan, South Korea, United States of America, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, Nepal, France, Malaysia, Canada, Germany, Sri Lanka, India, Cambodia, Finland, Italy, United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines.</p>
                <p><strong>What is PNU doing?</strong></p>
                <p>The University has carefully considered the current situation and is initiating measures to prevent the spread of the virus such as more thorough monitoring of people going in and out of the campus, careful preparations of equipment and facilities, and formulation of response protocols. Plans are underway to purchase additional rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizers, protective gear, and thermal scanners.</p>
                <p>As a precautionary measure, people entering the campus will have their temperature checked. Rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers will be available at the gates, restrooms, and strategic places around the campus. Protective masks will be provided by the University Health Services Unit (UHSU) until supplies last.</p>
                <p>In the interest of safety, faculty members, administrative staff, and students are encouraged to limit their activities, especially outside the University, to avoid exposure. Official travel to countries with confirmed cases will also be very limited.</p>
                <p>For those who have recently travelled to countries with confirmed cases and have experienced symptoms of severe respiratory illness or other signs of the 2019-nCoV, please seek medical attention immediately.</p>
                <p><strong>Safety Mechanisms:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li> Gate 1 and Gate 2 of the Main Entrance and HRD Gate will be used for entry and exit. Medical personnel are on standby on both gates, in case of emergency. Access to the other gates will be very limited.</li>
                  <li> The University Health Services Unit (UHSU) has a limited supply of protective gear; thus faculty members, administrative staff, and students are encouraged to provide for their own.</li>
                  <li> Prevention is better than cure. Always practice good personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water and disinfect whenever possible.</li>
                  <li> Stay calm but vigilant at all times.</li>
                  <li> Anyone experiencing any symptoms of the 2019-nCoV is advised to seek medical attention immediately and stay home to rest.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The University is currently monitoring the situation with the help of other government agencies. </p>
                <p>Further announcements regarding the 2019-nCoV will be released once they are available. </p>
                <p>For concerns, inquiries, and assistance, please contact the UHSU through (+63 2) 5317.1768 loc. 592 or via email at <strong>uhsu@pnu.edu.ph</strong>. </p>

                <p>With the recent developments on the COVID-19 outbreak and the increasing number of incidents not only in the Philippines but around the globe, the Philippine Normal University continues to exercise vigilance and proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
                <p>Faculty members, administrative staff, and students are still encouraged to limit their activities, especially outside the University, to avoid exposure. Official travel to countries with or without confirmed cases will likewise be very limited.</p>

                  <li> Prevention is better than cure. Always practice good personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle. Wash hands frequently with soap and water and disinfect with alcohol-based solutions whenever possible. Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent contamination. Make sure to follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering the mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then disposing of the used tissue paper immediately.</li>
                  <li> Boost the immune system by eating healthy food and taking vitamins, if any.</li>
                  <li> Maintain social distancing. Make sure to leave at least 1 meter distance from anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</li>
                  <li> Stay calm but vigilant at all times. Do not panic.</li>
                  <li> Anyone experiencing any symptoms of the COVID-19 is advised to seek medical attention immediately and stay home to rest.</li>
