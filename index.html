          <h2>About COVID-19</h2>
          <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). </p><br>
          <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.</p><br>
          <p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. </p><br>
          <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. </p><br>
          <p>Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p><br>

              <br>
              <p>Dear PNU Community,</p>
              <p>As announced by President Rodrigo R. Duterte and the members of the IATF on the evening of March 16, 2020, the "enhanced" community quarantine status now covering the entire Luzon completely suspends all modes of mass public transport to limit public mobility.</p>
              <p>In view of this, the previous issuances and guidelines relevant to the skeletal workforce in PNU Manila, subsequently adapted by PNU South Luzon and PNU North Luzon, are now RESCINDED. This means that work in PNU Manila and the two campuses are now totally suspended until further notice.</p>
              <p>To ensure that we still address the basic concerns in our respective offices, heads of units/offices are encouraged to provide their employees/staff (regular and COS) tasks/deliverables that they can accomplish at home, if possible. </p>
              <p>For PNU Visayas and PNU Mindanao, please follow the directives from your respective LGUs. If and when necessary, you may also come up with appropriate measures for the safety and protection of our employees. </p>
              <p>In this time of crisis and uncertainty, I urge everyone to remain calm and observe government protocol to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
              <p>Our collective prayers can also move mountains.</p>
              <p>Please take care of yourselves and your families.</p>

              <p>With the recent developments on the COVID-19 outbreak and the increasing number of incidents not only in the Philippines but around the globe, the Philippine Normal University continues to exercise vigilance and proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
              <p>Faculty members, administrative staff, and students are still encouraged to limit their activities, especially outside the University, to avoid exposure. Official travel to countries with or without confirmed cases will likewise be very limited.</p>
              <p>For those who have recently travelled to countries with confirmed cases and have experienced symptoms of severe respiratory illness or other signs of COVID-19, please seek medical attention immediately.</p>
              <p><strong>Safety mechanisms and protective measures:</strong></p>

                <li> Prevention is better than cure. Always practice good personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle. Wash hands frequently with soap and water and disinfect with alcohol-based solutions whenever possible. Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent contamination.

This means covering the mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then disposing of the used tissue paper immediately.</li>
                <li> Boost the immune system by eating healthy food and taking vitamins, if any.</li>
                <li> Maintain social distancing. Make sure to leave at least 1 meter distance from anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</li>
                <li> Stay calm but vigilant at all times. Do not panic.</li>
                <li> Anyone experiencing any symptoms of the COVID-19 is advised to seek medical attention immediately and stay home to rest.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The University is currently monitoring the situation with the help of other government agencies. Further announcements regarding the COVID-19 will be released once available.</p>

              <p>The University has carefully considered the current situation and is initiating measures to prevent the spread of the virus such as more thorough monitoring of people going in and out of the campus, careful preparations of equipment and facilities, and formulation of response protocols. Plans are underway to purchase additional rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizers, protective gear, and thermal scanners.</p>
              <p>As a precautionary measure, people entering the campus will have their temperature checked. Rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers will be available at the gates, restrooms, and strategic places around the campus. Protective masks will be provided by the University Health Services Unit (UHSU) until supplies last.</p>
