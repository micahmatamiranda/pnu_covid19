            <div class="content">
              <br>
              <p>Dear PNU Community,</p>
              <p>DOH data show a growing number of community transmission of COVID-19. Community transmission means that an illness spreads in such a way that the source of its infection is not traceable. An example is the case of Christopher De Leon, who has not traveled outside the Philippines nor has been exposed to or in close contact with a COVID-19 positive patient but has tested positive.</p>
              <p>WHO has identified the following most common signs and symptoms of COVID-19:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>Tiredness</li>
                <li>Dry Cough</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some patients may experience runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, body aches and pains, sore throat or diarrhea. Most patients manifest mild symptoms that develop gradually and recover without needing special treatment. Very few develop difficulty of breathing and most of them have other illnesses.</p>
              <p>If you experience any of these signs and symptoms please go to the nearest hospital or call <strong>DOH COVID-19 Emergency hotline 02-894-COVID (02-894-26843)</strong>.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <br>
              <p>Dear PNU Community,</p>
              <p>As announced by President Rodrigo R. Duterte and the members of the IATF on the evening of March 16, 2020, the "enhanced" community quarantine status now covering the entire Luzon completely suspends all modes of mass public transport to limit public mobility.</p>
              <p>In view of this, the previous issuances and guidelines relevant to the skeletal workforce in PNU Manila, subsequently adapted by PNU South Luzon and PNU North Luzon, are now RESCINDED. This means that work in PNU Manila and the two campuses are now totally suspended until further notice.</p>
              <p>To ensure that we still address the basic concerns in our respective offices, heads of units/offices are encouraged to provide their employees/staff (regular and COS) tasks/deliverables that they can accomplish at home, if possible. </p>
              <p>For PNU Visayas and PNU Mindanao, please follow the directives from your respective LGUs. If and when necessary, you may also come up with appropriate measures for the safety and protection of our employees. </p>
              <p>In this time of crisis and uncertainty, I urge everyone to remain calm and observe government protocol to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
              <p>Our collective prayers can also move mountains.</p>
              <p>Please take care of yourselves and your families.</p>
