                    <p>We're here to assist you!</p>
                    <p>In light of the current COVID-19 situation, the Philippine Normal University Office of Student Affairs and Student Services (OSASS) has launched the PNU CRISIS HELPLINE to help PNU students, faculty members, administrative staff, and frontliners reach free, confidential telephone crisis lines, information, and referral services. The PNU Crisis Helpline will be operating in a flexible working arrangement as we strive to provide continuing support and care for the mental and emotional well-being of the PNU Community and our frontliners in these times of crisis.</p>
                    <p>This program hopes to respond to the arising needs and concerns of our stakeholders. This is staffed by licensed counselors and trained volunteers from a network of crisis call centers located across Metro Manila and nearby provinces. It provides: (a) crisis intervention for people in emotional distress related to COVID-19; (b) information on how to recognize distress and its effects on individuals and families; (c) assistance related to medical, economic and academic concerns; and (d) referrals to trained responders in handling crises for additional follow-up care and support.</p>
                    <p>If you need assistance, leave us a message on our Facebook Page on how we can assist you.</p>

                    <p>PRESS RELEASE</p>
                    <p>PNU reaches out to frontliners and vulnerable populations; heeds government call for Bayanihan during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                    <p>PNU is strategically preparing and carefully planning to respond swiftly to the current public health emergency brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the proclamation of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), the University has already pursued actions to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its faculty members, administrative staff, students, and other stakeholders.</p>
                    <p>PNU President Bert J. Tuga, in one of the emergency Executive Council Meetings, emphasized that the safety of all employees and students must be prioritized so all activities have to be suspended in compliance with the government’s policies. Dr. Tuga also pointed out that the University must try every possible course to ensure continuity of delivery of basic services such as processing of salaries of all employees, regardless of their status.</p>
                    <p>Amidst the crisis, one priority action undertaken was the fast track processing and immediate release of salaries and clothing allowance of all regular employees including salaries of Contract of Service (COS) employees for the months of March and April.</p>
                    <p>Cognizant of the government’s call for cooperation and volunteerism, PNU has immediately responded by initiating a donation drive for the vulnerable populations and the frontliners of the City of Manila. On March 23, 2020, PNU, through the Community Partnership and Extension Office (CPEO), activated the Disaster Emergency Assistance and Relief (DEAR) Program, a three-day donation drive which was able to gather cash donations from faculty members, administrative staff, and alumni amounting to two hundred sixteen thousand five hundred fifty pesos (Php 216,550.00). The fund directly went to PGH Medical Foundation, Inc., the Province of Agusan Del Sur-DRRM, and the local government unit (LGU) of Alicia, Isabela.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the fund-raising activity, the PNU Campuses were also active in addressing the needs of their respective communities. PNU North Luzon, PNU Visayas, and PNU Mindanao have produced 340 face shields for the frontliners distributed to two (2) LGUs (Alicia, Isabela and Bayugan City), four (4) hospitals and clinics in Negros Occidental, and one (1) hospital in Agusan del Sur, respectively. </p>
                    <p>The reality of the current situation calls for a uniquely Filipino tradition—Bayanihan. PNU, an institution living up to its ideal of Service as one of its core values, distributed 331 packs of relief goods to 300 families in Cadiz City and Alicia, Isabela and food packs for 31 families of construction workers in PNU Mindanao. Even with the suspension of classes, the welfare of PNU students are still of utmost concern. Together with the Office of Student Affairs and Student Services (OSASS) and the University Student Council (USC), the University was able to identify and provide assistance to ten (10) students of PNU Manila who were forced to remain in their respective dormitories and boarding houses when the ECQ was implemented in Luzon. The first batch of food packs and hygiene kits amounting to one thousand pesos (Php 1000.00) per student were distributed to help augment their resources during the lockdown period. In response to the recent call of President Rodrigo R. Duterte to help the needy in the spirit of Bayanihan, PNU has reactivated its DEAR donation drive on April 8, 2020 to make way for the second wave of fund-raising to support vulnerable populations of PNU’s partner Barangays in the City of Manila and some members of the PNU community who are experiencing difficulty coping with the current crisis.</p>
                    <p>As part of the University’s preventive measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 among the PNU community, PNU issued a series of memoranda and advisories consistent with the mitigating guidelines and policies issued by the national government and the World Health Organization (WHO). These were disseminated via email and posted on PNU’s Facebook Page, to reach a wider audience of stakeholders.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the University launched PNU Teaching and Advocacy for Lifetime Knowledge and Skills (TALKS), an online education and advocacy campaign. This project is in the form of webinars posted on PNU’s Facebook Page, facilitated by select faculty members, who discussed issues and worthwhile activities to engage in amidst the ECQ. As of April 8, 2020, PNU TALKS has already aired seven (7) episodes and has been viewed at home by thousands in social media. The videos are accessible through Facebook and through PNU’s YouTube channel.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Tuga ensures that PNU is closely monitoring the situation and shall continue to take appropriate and coordinated actions. The University shall adopt or develop policies to help the government curb the spread of COVID 19 in the country. It will continue to do its share as an institution and as a member the Filipino community. Until this crisis ends, PNU will continue to extend help and serve as a vigorous partner of the national government against COVID-19.</p>

                    <p>With the aim of helping the community during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine Normal University Visayas has produced and distributed fabricated face shields to the health frontliners of the Province of Negros Occidental. The beneficiaries are: (1) Corazon Locsin Memorial Regional Hospital, Bacolod City (140); (2) Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, Bacolod City (20); (3) Cadiz City District Hospital/St. Anne Hospital (50); and (4) Cadiz City Emergency Clinic (20). Next week, PNU Visayas is targeting the distribution of 50 face shields to the PNP personnel of Cadiz City. </p>
                    <p>Sincerest thanks to the faculty members and alumni who volunteered to make the face shields.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the Faculty Association and the DRRM Unit of the Campus also distributed relief goods to the vulnerable population of its partner community: Brgy. Zone 1 and Brgy. Daga in Cadiz City.</p>
